1. Got below error in zookeeper statefulset when checked the pod logs:

kubectl logs signoz-zookeeper-0 --previous
mkdir: cannot create directory '/bitnami/zookeeper/data': Permission denied

Solution:
As it is test environment I gave root permissions to zookeeper pod so it can create a directory and file easily on the host volume i.e worker node.
If it had been production we should give limited read and write permissions to pod and prevent any security concerns.



2. Got below error in clickhouse statefulset as well in pod logs:

kubectl logs chi-signoz-clickhouse-cluster-0-0-0 --previous
std::exception. Code: 1001, type: std::__1::__fs::filesystem::filesystem_error, e.what() = filesystem error: in create_directories: Permission denied

Solution:
Same as zookeeper given root access to create directory and files easily on worker node.


3. Struggled to get logs into SigNos Cloud and did following things:

Gone through the documents as below:
https://signoz.io/docs/tutorial/kubernetes-infra-metrics/
https://signoz.io/docs/metrics-management/k8s-infra-otel-config/


And found that was missing the important configuration in override-values.yaml file:

presets:
  otlpExporter:
    enabled: true

Rest everything seems fine.

Please let me know if am missing something or have done any incorrect step.
